            <h1>How to Calculate LSAC GPA (Step-by-Step Using LSAC CAS Rules)</h1>
            <p>To estimate your LSAC GPA, you must follow the procedure used by the Law School Admissions Council's
                Credential Assembly Service (LSAC CAS), not your university's internal GPA system.</p>
            <p>LSAC recalculates all undergraduate coursework using its own standardized grading rules, which is why
                your LSAC GPA will often differ—sometimes significantly—from the GPA your school reports.</p>
            <p>LSAC reports GPA on a maximum scale of 4.33, but higher values ​​are only given in certain cases (such as
                transcripts that clearly distinguish an A+). Because LSAC applies the same rules across all
                institutions, understanding this process can help you predict how your GPA will appear on your official
                CAS report.</p>
        </section>

        <section class=" clm">
            <h2>1. Collect All Your Courses:</h2>
            <p>To calculate your LSAC GPA, start by collecting official transcripts from each postsecondary institution,
                including community colleges, summer programs, and transfer schools. LSAC requires a complete
                undergraduate academic record and does not allow applicants to skip coursework.</p>
            <p>Record each course with its final grade and credit hours, as LSAC weights grades based on credits earned.
                Importantly, LSAC includes all undergraduate efforts, even if your university has previously changed or
                waived grades.</p>
            <p>Pass/fail, audited, and non-credit courses are excluded from the GPA calculation. For international
                education, LSAC requires official transcripts, and many international records are summarized rather than
                converted to a numerical GPA.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>
        <section class=" clm">
            <h2>2. Converting All Your Grades:</h2>
            <p>The next step is to convert each eligible course grade to LSAC’s standardized grading scale. LSAC does
                not use your institution’s calculated GPA; instead, it evaluates individual course grades using a
                uniform framework to ensure consistency across schools.</p>
            <p>For U.S. and Canadian transcripts, letter grades are converted individually (for example, A- = 3.7, B+ =
                3.3, B = 3.0, F = 0.0). An A+ may be awarded up to 4.33 only if the transcript explicitly distinguishes
                it; otherwise, A and A+ are typically treated as 4.0.</p>
            <p>All undergraduate grades that count toward LSAC GPA—including repeated courses—should be converted.
                Pass/fail, audited, and non-credit courses are excluded. For international transcripts, LSAC applies its
                own credential evaluation process, and a numeric GPA may not be assigned in all cases.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>
        <section class="clm">
            <h2>3. Multiply Each Grade by the Credit Hours:</h2>
            <p>After converting each grade to its LSAC value, multiply that value by the course’s credit hours to
                calculate weighted grade points. This step reflects LSAC’s credit-weighted system, where higher-credit
                courses have a greater impact on your overall GPA.</p>
            <p>For example, a 3.7 grade in a 3-credit course equals 11.1 grade points, while a 3.0 grade in a 4-credit
                course equals 12.0 grade points. Ensure that only LSAC-eligible courses are included and that repeated
                courses use their original grades.</p>
            <p>For organization and error prevention, add a spreadsheet column for weighted grade points so you can
                easily verify calculations and identify high-impact courses.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>
        <section class="clm">
            <h2>4. Sum of Weighted Grade Points and Total Credit Hours:</h2>
            <p>Once all courses are weighted, sum the weighted grade points to calculate your total grade points earned.
                Separately, add together the credit hours for all courses that count toward LSAC GPA.</p>
            <p>Exclude pass/fail, audited, and non-credit courses, but include all repeated undergraduate coursework,
                regardless of institutional grade replacement policies. This step ensures that both the numerator (grade
                points) and denominator (credit hours) align with LSAC CAS standards.</p>
            <p>Maintaining a clear spreadsheet total helps catch missing courses or conversion errors before the final
                calculation.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>
        <section class="clm">
            <h2>5. Divide Total Weighted Grade Points by Total Credit Hours:</h2>
            <p>Divide your total weighted grade points by your total LSAC-eligible credit hours to estimate your LSAC
                GPA. The result is reported on LSAC’s 4.33 scale and rounded to two decimal places.</p>
            <p>Because LSAC weights courses by credit hours, high-credit classes can significantly influence your GPA.
                Even small calculation or rounding errors can affect your final estimate, so double-check totals
                carefully.</p>
            <p>Remember that this calculation provides an estimate; LSAC CAS determines the official GPA shown on your
                law school applications.</p>

        <section class="clm">
            <h2>6. Important Adjustments for LSAC:</h2>
            <p>LSAC applies specific rules that often cause GPA differences compared to university calculations. All
                undergraduate attempts are included, even if your institution replaces or forgives grades.</p>
            <p>Pass/fail, audited, and non-credit courses are excluded, while transfer credits without a grade are not
                factored into GPA. For many international transcripts, LSAC does not assign a numeric GPA and instead
                provides a qualitative summary.</p>
            <p>LSAC rounds GPAs to two decimal places, and because higher-credit courses are weighted more heavily, a
                single low grade can have a disproportionate impact on your final CAS GPA.</p>

            <h2>Why LSAC GPA Is Different from Your University GPA</h2>

            <p>
                Your LSAC GPA is often different from your university GPA because the
                <a href="https://www.lsac.org/credential-assembly-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Law
                    School Admission Council (LSAC)</a>
                recalculates every undergraduate course using standardized rules, regardless of your institution’s
                internal grading policies.
                This process ensures fairness and consistency across applicants from different colleges and
                universities.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Grade Replacement:</strong> Many universities replace low grades when a course is repeated, but
                LSAC counts all undergraduate attempts,
                including original and repeated grades. As a result, applicants who relied on grade forgiveness policies
                frequently see a lower LSAC GPA.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Grading Scale Standardization:</strong> Universities use different GPA scales and weighting
                systems, while LSAC converts individual
                course grades to its own standardized scale with a maximum of 4.33. In some cases, grades such as A+ may
                not receive extra weight unless
                the transcript explicitly distinguishes them, which can further change the final GPA.
            </p>

            <p>
                LSAC also excludes certain coursework that may appear in your university GPA, such as pass/fail,
                audited, and non-credit courses.
                Transfer credits without a grade are not factored into GPA calculations, even if they count toward
                degree completion at your institution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of these recalculations, it is common for an applicant’s LSAC GPA to be lower than their
                school-reported GPA.
                Understanding these differences helps you set realistic expectations and avoid confusion when reviewing
                your official LSAC Credential Assembly Service (CAS) report.

            <h2>Common Mistakes When Calculating or Estimating LSAC GPA</h2>

            <p>
                Many applicants miscalculate their LSAC GPA because they apply their university’s grading rules instead
                of LSAC’s standardized methodology.
                Avoiding the following common mistakes can help you produce a more realistic estimate and prevent
                surprises when reviewing your official CAS report.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assuming grade replacement applies:</strong> A frequent error is excluding earlier attempts
                    of repeated courses.
                    While many universities replace low grades, LSAC counts all undergraduate attempts, including
                    original and repeated grades, which often lowers the final GPA.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Treating all A+ grades as 4.33:</strong> Not every A+ receives extra weight. LSAC only
                    awards up to 4.33 if the transcript explicitly distinguishes an A+ from an A.
                    Otherwise, both are typically treated as 4.0, which can reduce expected GPA gains.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Using your university-calculated GPA:</strong> LSAC does not use institutional GPAs. It
                    recalculates GPA from individual course grades,
                    meaning your school-reported GPA is not a reliable indicator of your LSAC GPA.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Including pass/fail or audited courses:</strong> Pass/fail, audited, and non-credit courses
                    are excluded from LSAC GPA calculations,
                    even if they appear on your transcript or count toward graduation requirements.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Expecting a numeric GPA for international coursework:</strong> Many international
                    transcripts do not receive a numeric LSAC GPA and are summarized qualitatively instead.
                    Attempting to convert international grades on your own can lead to inaccurate estimates.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Understanding and avoiding these mistakes helps ensure your LSAC GPA estimate closely reflects LSAC CAS
                methodology and builds confidence when submitting law school applications.

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 1: Convert Grades to LSAC Values</strong><br>
                    Each eligible undergraduate grade is converted individually using LSAC’s standardized scale. Both

                    <strong>Step 2: Multiply by Credit Hours</strong><br>
                    Each LSAC grade value is multiplied by its credit hours to calculate weighted grade points.
                    <br><em>Total weighted grade points:</em> 12.0 + 13.2 + 8.0 + 14.8 = 48.0

            <h2>What LSAC GPA Law Schools Actually See</h2>

            <p>
                Law schools do not see the GPA you calculate manually. Instead, they receive an official
                <a href="https://www.lsac.org/credential-assembly-service" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Credential Assembly Service (CAS)</a>
                report prepared by the Law School Admission Council (LSAC). This report standardizes academic records
                across applicants and allows admissions committees
                to compare GPAs fairly, regardless of institution or grading system.
            </p>

            <p>
                The CAS report includes your LSAC-calculated GPA, which reflects all undergraduate coursework evaluated
                under LSAC’s grading rules.
                This GPA may differ from your university GPA due to LSAC’s inclusion of repeated courses, exclusion of
                pass/fail credits, and standardized grade conversions.
                Law schools rely on this LSAC GPA—not the institutional GPA listed on your transcript—when assessing
                academic performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the numeric GPA, law schools often review GPA trends across semesters, such as
                improvement over time or consistency in upper-division coursework.
                LSAC also provides contextual information that helps admissions officers interpret grades within a
                broader academic framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                For applicants with international education, the CAS report may present a qualitative academic summary
                instead of a numeric GPA.
                Admissions committees are familiar with these summaries and evaluate them alongside LSAT scores,
                personal statements, and other application materials.
            </p>

            <p>
                Understanding what law schools actually receive helps you interpret your LSAC GPA in context and focus
                on presenting a balanced, competitive application
                rather than relying solely on a single number. For a quick estimate of your LSAC GPA, you can try our

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) — LSAC GPA</h2>

            <details class="clm">
                <summary>Does LSAC include repeated courses in GPA calculation?</summary>
                <p>Yes. LSAC includes all undergraduate attempts, even if your university replaces or forgives earlier
                    grades. This is one of the most common reasons LSAC GPA differs from institutional GPA.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="clm">
                <summary>Is LSAC GPA the same as my undergraduate GPA?</summary>
                <p>No. LSAC recalculates GPA using its own standardized rules through the Credential Assembly Service
                    (CAS). Law schools rely on the LSAC GPA, not the GPA reported by your university.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="clm">
                <summary>Does LSAC give extra points for an A+?</summary>
                <p>Only in specific cases. LSAC may award up to 4.33 for an A+ if the transcript explicitly
                    distinguishes it. Otherwise, A and A+ are typically treated as 4.0.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="clm">
                <summary>Are pass/fail or audited courses included in LSAC GPA?</summary>
                <p>No. Pass/fail, audited, and non-credit courses are excluded from LSAC GPA calculations, even if they
                    appear on your transcript.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="clm">
                <summary>How does LSAC calculate GPA for international students?</summary>
                <p>Many international transcripts do not receive a numeric LSAC GPA. Instead, LSAC provides a
                    qualitative academic summary that law schools review alongside other application materials.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="clm">
                <summary>Can I calculate my LSAC GPA exactly?</summary>
                <p>You can estimate your LSAC GPA by following LSAC CAS rules, but only LSAC determines the official GPA
                    reported to law schools. Minor differences in conversion or credit weighting may occur.
