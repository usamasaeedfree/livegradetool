            <h1>How to Calculate LSAC GPA (Step-by-Step Guide)</h1>
            <p>Calculating your LSAC GPA is not the same as calculating your college GPA. The Law School Admissions
                Council uses its own standardized methodology. This recalculated GPA appears on your academic reports.
                This number is essential, and all law schools review it.</p>
            <p>I’ll walk you through the exact process of using the LSAC and what grades are included or excluded. We
                also clarify common points of confusion like repeated or failed courses and institutional grade
                forgiveness.</p>
            <p>By the end, you’ll understand not only how to calculate your LSAC GPA but also why it’s different from
                your transcript GPA. Let’s get started.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>
        <section id="what-is-lsac-gpa" class="clm">
            <h2>What Is LSAC GPA?</h2>
            <p>The LSAC GPA is a standardized grade point average that is recalculated by CAS for U.S. and Canadian law
                school applicants. It is not taken directly from your college transcript. This assembly recalculates our
                grades to ensure that all applicants are assessed on a consistent scale.</p>
            <p>It appears on your Academic Summary Report, which is sent to law schools as part of your Credential
                Assembly Services (CAS) report. For admissions, the CAS GPA is often more important than the GPA from
                your undergraduate institution.</p>
            <p>The goal of standardizing GPA is to ensure that colleges and universities follow different grading scales
                and policies, and LAC eliminates these institutional differences by applying its own unique methodology
                to each applicant’s record.</p>

        <section id="how-lsac-gpa-different" class="clm">
            <h2>How LSAC GPA Is Different From College GPA</h2>
            <p>The LSAC GPA often differs from your college or university GPA because LSAC does not follow institutional
                grading policies. Instead, it applies the same grading system to each transcript to create consistency
                among applicants.</p>
            <p>The most important differences include:</p>
            <p><strong>All course attempts are counted:</strong> If you repeated a course to make up for a low grade,
                LSAC counts both the original and repeated grades. Many universities exclude the first attempt. LSAC
                does not.</p>
            <p><strong>Failed courses are included:</strong> Any course in which you received a failing grade is
                included in your LSAC GPA, even if the course did not count toward your degree or was later retaken.</p>
            <p><strong>Institutional-grade waivers are ignored:</strong> Academic waivers, grade amnesties, or
                retrospective withdrawals granted by your school will not be recognized by LSAC if the original grade
                appears on the transcript.</p>
            <p><strong>Withdrawals can be counted:</strong> Withdrawn courses are evaluated based on how they appear on
                the transcript. If the withdrawal contains a penal grade (such as WF), LSAC may treat it as a failing
                grade.</p>
            <p><strong>Pass/fail courses are generally excluded:</strong> Courses that are strictly graded as pass/fail
                generally do not affect the LSAC GPA unless the failing grade is explicitly listed.</p>
            <p>Because of these rules, the LSAC GPA is often lower than the student's reported undergraduate GPA,
                especially for applicants who repeated courses or took advantage of institutional grade change policies.
            </p>
            <p>It is very important to understand these differences before attempting to calculate your LSAC GPA, as
                using your school's GPA rules will almost always yield an incorrect result.</p>

            <h2>LSAC GPA Calculation Rules</h2>
            <p>LSAC calculates GPA using a strict, rules-based methodology designed to standardize the academic records
                of all applicants. Before performing any calculations, it is important to understand what grades and
                credits are included in LSAC and how they are treated.</p>
            <p><strong>Undergraduate coursework only.</strong> The LSAC GPA includes all undergraduate-level courses
                completed before your first bachelor's degree was awarded. Any coursework taken after you received your
                degree—such as postbaccalaureate or graduate courses—is excluded from the GPA calculation.</p>
            <p><strong>Counting grades appear on your official transcript.</strong> Any grade that appears on your
                official undergraduate transcript is subject to LSAC evaluation. If a grade appears, it is generally
                counted, regardless of whether your institution considers it lenient, waived, or inapplicable.</p>
            <p><strong>Credit hours determine weighting.</strong> Each course is weighted according to the number of
                credit hours assigned by the institution. Courses with more credits have a greater impact on the final
                LSAC GPA.</p>
            <p><strong>Letter grades are converted to LSAC grade points.</strong> LSAC converts all letter grades into
                standardized numeric values using its grade conversion scale. These grade points are then multiplied by
                the course’s credit hours to generate quality points.</p>
            <p><strong>Pass/Fail and Ungraded Courses.</strong> Courses that are strictly graded as Pass (P), Credit
                (CR), or Satisfactory (S) are generally excluded from GPA calculations. However, a recorded Fail (F) or
                No Pass (NP) may be included if it carries a numerical weight.</p>
            <p><strong>Withdrawal depends on the notation.</strong> Dropped courses are reviewed individually. A
                non-punitive withdrawal (such as W) is generally excluded, while a punitive withdrawal (such as WF) may
                be considered a failing grade.</p>
            <p><strong>Remedial and Developmental Coursework.</strong> If remedial courses appear on the transcript with
                assigned grades and credit values, LSAC may include them in the GPA calculation.</p>
            <p>These principles form the basis of the LSAC GPA calculation. Once you understand what is included and how
                it is weighted, you can accurately calculate your LSAC GPA using the official conversion scale and
                formula.</p>

            <p>If your institution does not assign plus or minus grades, LSAC converts grades to the nearest equivalent
                on this scale. However, numerics and percentages, or alternative grading systems, are also translated by
                LSAC's standardized format during transcript processing.</p>
            <p>This conversion step is necessary because all LSAC GPA calculations are based on grade points multiplied
                by credit hours, not institutional GPA formulas. After grades are converted, you can calculate total
                quality points and your final LSAC GPA.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Calculate LSAC GPA</h2>
            <p>Once you understand LSAC’s rules and grade conversion scale, calculating your LSAC GPA becomes a
                structured, repeatable process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure accuracy.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 1: List all eligible undergraduate courses.</h3>
            <p>List every undergraduate-level course taken before your first bachelor's degree that appears on your
                transcript. Include repeated courses and failed courses. Exclude graduate or postbaccalaureate
                coursework.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 2: Record credit hours for each course.</h3>
            <p>Note the number of credit hours assigned to each course. Credit hours determine how much weight each
                course carries in the final GPA calculation.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 3: Convert letter grades to LSAC grade points.</h3>
            <p>Using the LSAC grade conversion table, convert each course’s letter grade into its corresponding numeric
                grade point value.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 4: Calculate quality points for each course.</h3>
            <p>Multiply the LSAC grade points by the course’s credit hours. The result is the course’s quality points.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 5: Add total quality points.</h3>
            <p>Sum the quality points from all included courses to obtain your total quality points.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 6: Add total graded credit hours.</h3>
            <p>Sum the credit hours for all courses that received a graded evaluation and were included in the
                calculation.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 7: Divide to calculate LSAC GPA.</h3>
            <p>Divide the total quality points by the total graded credit hours. The resulting number is your LSAC GPA.
            </p>

            <p>This step-by-step method reflects the process used by LSAC when preparing your Academic Summary Report.
                Any deviations—such as repeatedly dropping grades or applying institutional exemptions—will produce an
                incorrect result.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 1: Add total quality points.</h3>
            <p>12.00 + 10.68 + 6.99 + 4.00 + 12.00 = 45.67</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 2: Add total graded credit hours.</h3>
            <p>3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 18</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 3: Divide to calculate LSAC GPA</h3>

            <p>In this example, both attempts at Math 120 are included in the calculation. Although the student improved
                his or her grade on the repeat attempt, LSAC counts all grades earned, which reduces the final GPA
                compared to institutional grade change policies.</p>

            <p>This example illustrates why the LSAC GPA often differs from the student’s reported undergraduate GPA and
                highlights the importance of understanding the LSAC methodology.</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes Students Make When Calculating LSAC GPA</h2>
            <p>Many applicants miscalculate their LSAC GPA because they rely on their university's GPA rules instead of
                the standard LSAC methodology. The following are the most common and most costly mistakes.</p>

            <p><strong>Excluding repeated courses.</strong> A common mistake is counting the highest grade earned in a
                repeated course. LSAC includes all attempts, regardless of improvement.</p>

            <p><strong>Ignoring Failed Grades.</strong> Some students assume that failed courses no longer matter if the
                credit was not applied toward graduation. If a failing grade appears on a transcript, LSAC counts it.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Applying Institutional Grade Forgiveness.</strong> Academic forgiveness, grade changes, or
                forgiveness policies used by colleges do not apply to LSAC GPA calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Misshandling Withdrawals:</strong> Treating all withdrawals as non-penalties can lead to errors.
                Withdrawals marked with penal designations (such as WF) may be counted as failing grades.</p>

            <p><strong>Including post-baccalaureate coursework.</strong> Courses taken after you earned your first
                bachelor's degree are excluded from the LSAC GPA, even if they are academically relevant.</p>

            <p><strong>Using a Standard GPA Calculator.</strong> Most online GPA calculators follow institutional rules
                and will not produce an accurate LSAC GPA.</p>

            <p>It is important to avoid these mistakes. Even small calculation errors can significantly change how law
                schools view your academic performance.</p>

            <h2>Why Your LSAC GPA May Be Lower Than Expected</h2>
            <p>Many students are surprised when their LSAC GPA is lower than the GPA reported by their undergraduate
                institution. Several factors contribute to this difference.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Inclusion of all attempts.</strong> LSAC counts every grade earned, including repeated
                    courses. Unlike many universities that replace low grades, LSAC includes all attempts in the
                    calculation.</li>
                <li><strong>Counting failing grades.</strong> Any course with a failing grade visible on the transcript
                    is included, even if the student later passed the course or the credit was not applied toward
                    graduation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring institutional forgiveness policies.</strong> Grade replacement, academic amnesty,
                    or similar policies do not affect LSAC calculations. LSAC prioritizes standardized assessment over
                    institutional discretion.</li>
                <li><strong>Exclusion of non-graded courses.</strong> LSAC excludes pass/fail courses without numerical
                    grades and any coursework completed after the first bachelor's degree. This often reduces the total
                    GPA compared to the transcript GPA, which may include non-graded or post-baccalaureate courses.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of small courses with low grades.</strong> Courses with low credit hours but poor
                    grades can slightly lower GPA. Every numeric grade counts proportionally, and LSAC’s method ensures
                    no grade is overlooked.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Understanding these reasons helps applicants anticipate why their LSAC GPA may differ from the GPA shown
                on their college transcript and prevents confusion when interpreting the Academic Summary Report.</p>

            <h2>FAQs – People Also Ask</h2>
            <p>To further clarify LSAC GPA calculations and address common queries, here are frequently asked questions
                applicants search for:</p>

            <h3>Q1: Does LSAC recalculate GPA?</h3>
            <p>Yes. LSAC recalculates all undergraduate grades to produce a standardized GPA for law school admissions.
                This ensures consistency across applicants from different institutions.</p>

            <h3>Q2: Do repeated courses count toward the LSAC GPA?</h3>
            <p>Yes, LSAC includes all repeated course attempts. Both original and repeated grades are included in the
                GPA.</p>

            <h3>Q3: Do failed courses count?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Any failing grade that appears on the transcript is included in the LSAC GPA calculation, even if
                the course was later retaken or the credit was not applied toward graduation.</p>

            <h3>Q4: Does LSAC GPA replace my undergraduate GPA?</h3>
            <p>No. Your undergraduate GPA is still listed on your transcript, but law schools primarily reference your
                LSAC GPA when evaluating applications.</p>

            <h3>Q5: Are pass/fail courses included?</h3>
            <p>Typically, no. Pass/fail or similar non-graded courses are excluded unless a failing grade is explicitly
                recorded.</p>

            <h3>Q6: Why is my LSAC GPA lower than my college GPA?</h3>
            <p>Differences arise because LSAC counts all attempts, includes failing grades, ignores institutional
                forgiveness, and excludes certain post-baccalaureate or non-graded courses.</p>

            <p>Including an FAQ section increases clarity, answers common queries, and aligns with Google’s People Also
                Ask results, boosting the article’s search relevance and user satisfaction.</p>
