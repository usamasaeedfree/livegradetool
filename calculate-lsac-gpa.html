            <h1>How to Calculate LSAC GPA (Step-by-Step Guide)</h1>
            <p class="special">By <strong>Usama</strong>, Law School Admissions Content Specialist <strong> |
                </strong> <b>Published:</b> <time datetime="2026-01-31">January 31, 2026</time></p>

            <p>Calculating your LSAC GPA is not the same as calculating your college GPA. The Law School Admissions
                Council (LSAC) applies a standardized evaluation methodology that differs from institutional grading
                policies. This recalculated GPA appears on your Academic Summary Report and is reviewed by all
                ABA-accredited law schools during the admissions process.</p>
            <p>This guide is based on LSAC’s official Credential Assembly Service (CAS) GPA calculation methodology
                used in law school admissions. It explains how LSAC evaluates undergraduate transcripts, including
                repeated coursework, failing grades, withdrawals, and grading conversions. The steps outlined below
                reflect the same evaluation process LSAC uses when generating the Academic Summary Report sent to
                law schools.</p>
            <p>By the end of this guide, you will understand not only how to calculate your LSAC GPA accurately, but
                also why it often differs from the GPA reported by your undergraduate institution.</p>

                <h2>What Is LSAC GPA?</h2>
                <p>The LSAC GPA is a standardized grade point average recalculated by the Law School Admissions Council
                    (LSAC) through its Credential Assembly Service (CAS) for U.S. and Canadian law school applicants. It
                    is not taken directly from your undergraduate institution’s GPA. Instead, LSAC independently
                    evaluates all eligible undergraduate coursework using a uniform grading methodology.</p>
                <p>This recalculated GPA appears on your Academic Summary Report, which is included in your CAS report
                    and sent to law schools as part of the admissions process. For most ABA-accredited law schools, the
                    CAS GPA is the primary GPA used when reviewing applicants, rather than the GPA listed on the college
                    transcript.</p>
                <p>Because colleges and universities apply different grading scales, course repeat policies, and
                    academic forgiveness rules, LSAC standardizes GPA calculations to eliminate institutional
                    variability. This ensures that all applicants are evaluated consistently and equitably under the
                    same grading framework.</p>

                <h2>How LSAC GPA Is Different From College GPA</h2>
                <p>The LSAC GPA often differs from your college or university GPA because LSAC does not apply
                    institutional grading policies. Instead, LSAC evaluates every transcript using a standardized
                    grading framework to ensure consistency across all applicants.</p>
                <img src="/src/img/lsac-vs-college-gpa.webp" alt="differences Between lsac cas gpa vs college gpa"
                    width="1536" height="1024" loading="lazy">
                <p>According to LSAC’s official transcript evaluation policies, several rules explain why the LSAC GPA
                    frequently differs from an undergraduate institutional GPA.</p>

                <h3>Key Differences Between LSAC GPA and College GPA</h3>

                <p><strong>All course attempts are counted.</strong></p>
                <p>If you repeated a course to improve a low grade, LSAC includes both the original and repeated grades
                    in the GPA calculation. Many colleges replace the earlier grade; LSAC does not.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed courses are included.</strong></p>
                <p>Any course with a failing grade that appears on the transcript is included in the LSAC GPA, even if
                    the course did not count toward graduation or was later retaken.</p>

                <p><strong>Institutional grade forgiveness is ignored.</strong></p>
                <p>Academic amnesty, grade replacement, and similar institutional forgiveness policies do not affect
                    LSAC GPA calculations if the original grade remains visible on the transcript.</p>

                <p><strong>Withdrawals are evaluated by notation.</strong></p>
                <p>Non-punitive withdrawals (such as W) are generally excluded, while punitive withdrawals (such as WF)
                    are typically treated as failing grades.</p>

                <p><strong>Pass/fail courses are generally excluded.</strong></p>
                <p>Courses graded strictly as pass/fail do not affect the LSAC GPA unless a failing grade is explicitly
                    recorded.</p>

                <p>Because of these policies, the LSAC GPA is often lower than the GPA reported by an undergraduate
                    institution—particularly for applicants who repeated courses or benefited from institutional
                    grade-forgiveness policies.</p>
                <p>Understanding these differences is essential before attempting to calculate your LSAC GPA. Applying
                    your school’s GPA rules will almost always result in an inaccurate calculation.</p>

                <h2>LSAC GPA Calculation Rules</h2>
                <p>These rules reflect LSAC’s official Credential Assembly Service (CAS) transcript evaluation
                    standards.</p>
                <p>LSAC calculates GPA using a strict, rules-based methodology designed to standardize undergraduate
                    academic records across all applicants. Before performing any calculations, it is essential to
                    understand which grades and credits are included and how LSAC evaluates them.</p>

                <p><strong>Undergraduate coursework only.</strong></p>
                <p>The LSAC GPA includes all undergraduate-level courses completed before your first bachelor’s degree
                    was awarded. Any coursework completed after degree conferral—such as post-baccalaureate or graduate
                    coursework—is excluded from the LSAC GPA calculation.</p>

                <p><strong>All transcripted grades are evaluated.</strong></p>
                <p>Any grade that appears on your official undergraduate transcript is subject to LSAC evaluation.
                    Grades are generally counted regardless of whether your institution considers them forgiven, waived,
                    or excluded from its own GPA calculation.</p>

                <p><strong>Credit hours determine weighting.</strong></p>
                <p>Each course is weighted according to the number of credit hours assigned by the institution. Courses
                    with higher credit values have a greater impact on the final LSAC GPA.</p>

                <p><strong>Letter grades are converted to LSAC grade points.</strong></p>
                <p>LSAC converts all letter grades into standardized numeric grade points using its official conversion
                    scale. These grade points are then multiplied by the course’s credit hours to calculate quality
                    points.</p>

                <p><strong>Pass/fail and ungraded courses.</strong></p>
                <p>Courses graded strictly as Pass (P), Credit (CR), or Satisfactory (S) are generally excluded from
                    LSAC GPA calculations. However, a recorded Fail (F) or No Pass (NP) may be included if it carries
                    numerical weight on the transcript.</p>

                <p><strong>Withdrawals depend on transcript notation.</strong></p>
                <p>Non-punitive withdrawals (such as W) are typically excluded, while punitive withdrawals (such as WF)
                    may be treated as failing grades.</p>

                <p><strong>Remedial or developmental coursework.</strong></p>
                <p>Remedial or developmental courses may be included in the LSAC GPA if they appear on the transcript
                    with assigned grades and credit hours.</p>

                <p>These principles form the foundation of the LSAC GPA calculation. Once you understand what coursework
                    is included and how it is weighted, you can accurately calculate your LSAC GPA using the official
                    conversion scale and formula used by LSAC.</p>

                <h2>LSAC Grade Conversion Table</h2>
                <p>Before calculating your LSAC GPA, all letter grades must be converted to LSAC grade points. The Law
                    School Admissions Council (LSAC) uses a standardized conversion scale to ensure consistency across
                    different colleges and grading systems.</p>

                <p>If your college does not use plus or minus grades, LSAC converts your grades to the closest
                    equivalent. Numeric, percentage-based, and alternative grading systems are also standardized during
                    transcript evaluation.</p>

                <p>This conversion is essential because LSAC GPA calculations are based on grade points multiplied by
                    credit hours—not your institution’s GPA formula. Once grades are converted, you can calculate total
                    quality points to determine your final LSAC GPA accurately.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Calculate LSAC GPA</h2>
                <p>Calculating your LSAC GPA follows a standardized method used by the Law School Admissions Council
                    (LSAC) through the Credential Assembly Service (CAS). Follow these steps carefully to ensure
                    accuracy.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 1: Identify all eligible undergraduate coursework</h3>
                <p>Include all courses listed on your official transcript completed before your first bachelor’s degree.
                    <strong>Don’t forget:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dual enrollment or college courses taken in high school</li>
                    <li>Summer or community college courses</li>
                    <li>Study abroad grades listed on your transcript</li>
                    <li>Repeated courses and failed courses</li>
                    <li>Withdrawals with recorded grades</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Exclude post-baccalaureate, graduate, or professional coursework.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 2: Record credit hours</h3>
                <p>Note the number of credit hours assigned to each course. Remember:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quarter system schools:</strong> Convert quarter hours to semester hours using
                        <code>Semester Hours = Quarter Hours × 2/3</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Courses with higher credit hours carry more weight in your LSAC GPA.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 3: Convert letter grades to LSAC grade points</h3>
                <p>Use the official LSAC grade conversion table. Do <strong>not</strong> use your institution’s GPA.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 4: Calculate quality points</h3>
                <p>Multiply the LSAC grade points by the course’s credit hours to determine quality points for each
                    course.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 5: Total quality points</h3>
                <p>Add all quality points from included courses to get <strong>total quality points</strong>.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 6: Total graded credit hours</h3>
                <p>Add the credit hours for all courses included in the GPA calculation.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 7: Divide to get LSAC GPA</h3>
                <p><strong>LSAC GPA = Total Quality Points ÷ Total Graded Credit Hours</strong></p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 8: Consider withdrawals</h3>
                <p>LSAC treats withdrawals differently depending on transcript notation. Reference this table:</p>

                </div>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 28px;">Step 9: Study abroad & transfer grades</h3>
                <p>If study abroad or international grades appear on your primary US/Canadian transcript, include them.
                    Transfer credits without grades generally do not count.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Tip:</strong> Follow all these steps to match LSAC’s official CAS methodology. Excluding
                    repeated grades, ignoring failed courses, or applying institutional forgiveness policies will result
                    in an inaccurate LSAC GPA.</p>

                    <li>Quarter hours are converted to semester hours (× 2/3) to standardize GPA across institutions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Failed courses and repeats can lower your LSAC GPA compared to your institutional GPA.</li>

                <h2>Common Mistakes Students Make When Calculating LSAC GPA</h2>
                <p>Many law school applicants miscalculate their LSAC GPA by following their undergraduate institution’s
                    GPA rules rather than LSAC’s official methodology. Avoiding these mistakes is critical, as even
                    small errors can significantly affect how admissions committees view your academic record.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Excluding repeated courses</strong></p>
                <p>A common misconception is to only count the highest grade for repeated courses. LSAC includes all
                    attempts, even if your grade improved on subsequent attempts. Skipping any attempt will produce an
                    inaccurate GPA.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Ignoring failed grades</strong></p>
                <p>Some students assume that failing courses no longer count if the credit was not applied toward
                    graduation. Any failing grade visible on your transcript is included in LSAC’s calculation,
                    regardless of institutional policies.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Applying institutional grade forgiveness</strong></p>
                <p>Policies such as academic forgiveness, grade replacement, or grade amnesty used by your college do
                    not apply to LSAC GPA calculations. All original grades listed on your transcript are considered.
                </p>

                <p><strong>4. Mishandling withdrawals</strong></p>
                <p>Treating all withdrawals as non-penalties is incorrect. Withdrawals marked with penal designations
                    (e.g., WF) may be counted as failing grades. LSAC evaluates each withdrawal individually based on
                    transcript notation.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Including post-baccalaureate coursework</strong></p>
                <p>Courses taken after earning your first bachelor’s degree—such as graduate or post-baccalaureate
                    coursework—are excluded from your LSAC GPA, even if they are academically relevant.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Using standard GPA calculators</strong></p>
                <p>Most online GPA calculators follow institutional grading rules and cannot accurately reflect LSAC’s
                    methodology. Using them will often result in an incorrect CAS GPA.</p>

                <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Carefully following LSAC’s official rules ensures accurate GPA
                    calculation. Avoiding these common errors can help you present a clear and reliable academic profile
                    to law school admissions committees.</p>

                <h2>FAQs – People Also Ask About LSAC GPA</h2>

                <details>
                    <summary>Does LSAC recalculate GPA?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. LSAC recalculates all undergraduate coursework using the Credential Assembly Service (CAS)
                        to generate a standardized GPA for law school admissions. This ensures consistent evaluation
                        across all applicants, regardless of differing institutional grading policies.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Do repeated courses count toward the LSAC GPA?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. LSAC includes every attempt of a repeated course. Both the original and subsequent grades
                        are counted when calculating your CAS GPA.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Do failed courses count?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Any failing grade listed on your official transcript is included in the LSAC GPA
                        calculation, even if the course was later retaken or the credit was not applied toward
                        graduation.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Does LSAC GPA replace my undergraduate GPA?</summary>
                    <p>No. Your undergraduate GPA remains on your transcript, but law schools primarily reference your
                        LSAC GPA when evaluating applications. The LSAC GPA is the standard metric for fair comparison
                        among applicants.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Are pass/fail courses included?</summary>
                    <p>Generally, no. Courses graded strictly as pass/fail, credit, or satisfactory (e.g., P/NP, CR, S)
                        are excluded unless a failing grade is recorded.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Why is my LSAC GPA lower than my college GPA?</summary>
                    <p>LSAC GPA may be lower because it counts all course attempts, includes failing grades, ignores
                        institutional grade forgiveness policies, and excludes post-baccalaureate or non-graded courses.
                        These rules create a standardized GPA that often differs from your transcript GPA.</p>
